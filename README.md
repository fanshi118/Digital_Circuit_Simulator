# Digital_Circuit_Simulator
This program is able to simulate the functions of verilog circuits in c++ environment. It's one of my undergraduate projects at USC

## Steps to run

$ make autoparse

Run the simulation for 2-1 mux:
$ ./gsim mux21.v mux21.sim mux21.out

Run the simulation for 4-bit adder:
$ ./gsim adder4.v adder4.sim adder4.out

etc.
